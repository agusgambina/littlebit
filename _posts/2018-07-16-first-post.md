The name of the blog "Little Bit" is a pun. Little refers to something that can be small in size, short in duration, small in amount. Bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications.

I like technology and learning new things, and I will use this blog as a notebook.

This blog is running on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), the blog engine is [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the theme is [Hacker](https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker).

Thank you for reading, I hope you can enjoy it
